This folder is a file archive of the Brinell hardness test modelling that developed within the framework of [the Materials Open Laboratory (Mat-O-Lab)](https://github.com/Mat-o-Lab). Mat-o-Lab aims to develop domain ontologies for typical characterization methods in the field of MSE, predominantly in accordance with testing standards.  

This folder includes:

### Method graph 
The method graph was created in diagram.net using the Ontopanel plugin. It models the Brinell hardness testing with the MSEO ontology.

Ontopanel is a diagrams.net plugin designed to solve the problems that domain experts encounter when building ontologies graphically using diagrames.net, such as ontology reuse, ontology transformation and data mapping.

## Experimental dataset 

The experimental dataset is a secondary dataset of the published Brinell hardness testing dataset. It contains Brinell hardness (HBW 2.5/62.5) data for Al-alloy EN AW-2618A at different aging times and temperatures and is used for data mapping.

## Triple store in TTL format

The triple store is converted from method graph and experimental dataset using Ontopanel-Convertor.
